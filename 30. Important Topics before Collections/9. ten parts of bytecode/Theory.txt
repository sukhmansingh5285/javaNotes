The first four bytes of every Java class file are its magic number, 0xCAFEBABE. The magic number makes non-Java class files
easier to identify. If a file doesn't start with 0xCAFEBABE, it definitely is not a Java class file.

The second four bytes of the class file contain the minor and major version numbers. As Java technology evolves, new features may occasionally
be added to the Java class file format. Each time the class file format changes, the version numbers will change as well. To the Java Virtual
Machine, the version numbers identify the format to which a particular class files with a given majors version number and a range of minor
version numbers. Java Virtual Machines must reject class files with version numbers outside their valid range.
For class files generated by 1.0 or 1.1 compilers, the major version number is 45. The minor version number is 3.
