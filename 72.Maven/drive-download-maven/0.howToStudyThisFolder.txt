# 📚 How to Study This Maven Folder

This guide will help you understand the **sequence** and **purpose** of each folder and file provided for learning Maven. Follow the phases below for a smooth learning experience!

---

## 🟢 Phase 1: Installation & Setup
**Goal:** Get Maven running on your machine.

1. **`apache-maven-3.5.0`**
	- This is the Maven software. Place it in a permanent location (e.g., `C:\Program Files\apache-maven-3.5.0`).
2. **`springandmavenpath.txt`**
	- Contains setup instructions for environment variables.
	- **Action:**
	  - Set `JAVA_HOME`, `M2_HOME`, and update your `Path` as described.
	  - Open a new terminal and run: `mvn -version` to verify Maven is installed.

---

## 🟡 Phase 2: The Basics (Hello World)
**Goal:** Learn Maven project structure and build a simple Java app.

3. **`HelloJava`**
	- Your first Maven project. Teaches directory layout and `pom.xml` basics.
	- **Action:**
	  1. Read `HelloJava/steps.txt`.
	  2. Open a terminal in the `HelloJava` folder.
	  3. Run: `mvn clean install` (compiles and installs the JAR to your local Maven repo).

---

## 🟠 Phase 3: Dependency Management
**Goal:** Learn how Maven projects use each other as dependencies.

4. **`UsingOwnJar`**
	- Demonstrates using the JAR from `HelloJava` as a dependency.
	- **Action:**
	  1. Ensure you completed Phase 2.
	  2. Open a terminal in `UsingOwnJar`.
	  3. Run: `mvn clean install` (should succeed if `HelloJava` was installed).

---

## 🔵 Phase 4: Advanced Dependencies & Databases
**Goal:** Work with 3rd party libraries and databases.

5. **`jdbcwithmaven`**
	- Shows how to add external JARs (like Oracle drivers) to your local Maven repo.
	- **Action:**
	  - Read `steps.txt` for the `mvn install:install-file` command.
	  - Try MySQL/PostgreSQL examples if you have the databases.

6. **`Mongodbwithmaven`**
	- Demonstrates connecting to MongoDB using Maven dependencies.
	- **Action:**
	  - Check `MongoDbTest/pom.xml` for MongoDB driver.
	  - Run the example if MongoDB is installed.

---

## 🟣 Phase 5: Web Applications (Advanced)
**Goal:** Build and deploy a web application (WAR file).

7. **`mavenservlet2`**
	- A Maven web project that produces a `.war` file for deployment on Tomcat.
	- **Action:**
	  - Go to `demo` folder and run: `mvn clean install`.
	  - Deploy the generated WAR to a Tomcat server.

## ✅ Summary Checklist

- [ ] **Configure Paths** (`springandmavenpath.txt`)
- [ ] **Build HelloJava** (`mvn clean install`)
- [ ] **Build UsingOwnJar** (after HelloJava)
- [ ] **Study JDBC/Mongo** (database connectivity)
- [ ] **Study MavenServlet2** (web apps)

> **Tip:** Follow the phases in order. Each step builds on the previous one for a complete Maven learning experience!
