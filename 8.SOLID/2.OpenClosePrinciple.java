Now that we have covered the basics of the principle, let's apply it to our Invoice application.

Let's say our boss came to us and said that they want invoices to be saved to a database so that we can search them easily. We think
okay, this is easy peasy boss, just give me a second.

We create the database, connect to it, and we add a save method to our InvoicePersistence class

public class InvoicePersistence{
  Invoice invoice;

  }

  public void saveToFile (String filename){
    // Creates a file with given name and writes the invoice
  }

  public void saveToDatabase(){
    // Saves the invoice to database
  }

// If our class design obeyed the Open-Closed principle we would not need to change this class.

interface InvoicePersistence{
  public void save(Invoice invoice);

//We change the type of InvoicePersistence to Interface and add a save method. Each persistence class will implement this save method.

public class FilePersistence implements InvoicePersistence{
  public void save(Invoice invoice){
    // Save to file
  }
