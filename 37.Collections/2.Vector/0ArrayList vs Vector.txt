ArrayList vs Vector

1) Synchronization: ArrayList is non-synchronized which means multiple threads can work on ArrayList at the same time. For e.g.-> if one thread
 is performing an add operation on ArrayList, there can be an another thread perfoming remove operation on ArrayList at the same time in a 
 multithreaded environment.
 
 while vector is synchronized. This means if one thread is working on Vector, no other thread can get a hold of it. Unlike ArrayList, only one 
 thread can peform an operation on vector at a time.

2) Resize: Both ArrayList and Vector can grow and shrink dynamically to maintain the optimal use of storage, however the way they resized is different.
 ArrayList grow by half of its size when resized while Vector doubles the size of itself by default when grows.

3) Performance: ArrayList gives better perfomance as it is non-synchronized. Vector operations gives poor perfomance as they are thread-safe, the
 thread which works on Vector gets a lock on it which makes other thread wait till the lock is released.

4) fail-fast: If the collection (ArrayList, vector, etc) gets structurally modified by any means, except the add or remove methods of iterator, after 
 creation of iterator then the iterator will throw ConcurrentModificationException. Structural modification refers to the addition or deletion of
 elements from the collection.

As per the Vector javadoc the Enumeration returned by Vector is not fail-fast. On the other side the iterator and listIterator returned by ArrayList
are fail-fast.

5) Who belongs to collection framework really? The vector was not the part of collection framework, it has been included in collections later. 
 It can be considered as Legacy code. There is nothing about Vector which List collection can't do. Therefore Vector should be avoided.
 If there is a need of thread-safe operation make ArrayList synchronized as use CopyOnWriteArrayList which is a thread-safe variant of ArrayList.

6) In ArrayList we can't define the increment size but in vector we can define the increment size.

There are a few similarities between these classes which are as follows:
  Both Vector and ArrayList use growable array data structure.
  The iterator and listIterator returned by these classes (Vector and ArrayList) are fail-fast.
  They both are ordered collection classes as they maintain the elements insertion order.
  Vector & ArrayList both allows duplicate and null values.
  They both grows and shrinks automatically when overflow and deletion happens.

When to use ArrayList and when to use vector?
 It totally depends on requirement. If there is a need to perform "thread-safe" operation the vector is your best bet as it ensures that only one thread
 access the collection at a time.

Performance: Synchronized operations consumes more time compared to non-synchronized ones so if there is no need for thread safe operation, ArrayList is a
better choice as performance will be improved because of the concurrent processes.
