The life cycle of entity objects consists of four states: New, Managed, Removed and Detached.

// New
When an entity object is initially created its state is New. In this state, the object is not yet associated with an EntityManager and 
has no representation in the database. 
Example:- In below example, the Employee instance is constructed as an ordinary Java object and its initial 
state is New. Note that Employee instance not yet associated with an EntityManger.

Employee employee = new Employee("lalu", "bihar", "lalurabari");

// Managed
The managed state is maintained by below three methods:
1. EntityManager.persist(Entity object);
2. EntityManager.find(Long id)
3. Update Operation

1. EntityManager.persist() methods
  An entity object becomes Manged when it is persisted to the database via an EntityManager's persist method, which must be invoked within an
  active transaction. On transaction commit, the owning EntityManager stores the new entity object to the database.
  Example: The following code stores an instance of the Employee entity class in the database.

    Employee employee = new Employee("lalu", "yadav", "pune");
    em.getTransaction().begin();
    em.persist(employee);
    em.getTransaction().commit();

The Employee instance is constructed as an ordinary Java object and its intitial state is New. An explicit call to persist associates the object
with an owner EntityManager em and changes its state to Managed.
Note that the new entity object is stored in the database when the transaction is committed.

2. EntityManager.find() methods
  Entity objects retrieved from the database by an EntityManager are also in the Managed State.
  Example: The following code fragment demonstrates retrieval of an Employee object whose primary key is 1:
        Employee employee = em.find(Employee.class, 1);

3. Update Operation
  If a managed entity object is modified within an active transaction the change is detected by the owning EntityManager and the update is
  propagated to the database on transaction commit. Once an entity object is retrieved from the database(no matter which way), it can simply
  be modified in memory from inside an active transaction.

  Employee employee = em.find(Employee.class, 1);
  em.getTransaction().begin();
  employee.setNickname("Ram");
  em.getTransaction().commit();

The entity object is physically updated in the database when the transaction is committed. If the transaction is rolled back and not committed
the update is discarded.

// Removed->
A managed entity object can also be retrieved from the database and marked for deletion, by using the EntityManager's remove method within an
active transaction. The entity object changes its state from Managed to Removed and is physically deleted from the database during commit.

Example: In order to delete an object from the database it has to first retrieved (no matter which way) and then in an active transaction, it
can be deleted using the remove method:
    Employee employee = em.find(Employee.class, 1);
    em.getTransaction().begin();
    em.remove(employee);
    em.getTransaction().commit();

Note: The entity object is physically deleted from the database when the transaction is committed. Embedded objects that are contained in the
entity object are also deleted. If the transaction is rolled back and not committed the object is not deleted.

// Detached -> 
The last state, Detached, represents entity objects that have been disconnected from the EntityManager. For instance, all the managed objects of
an EntityManager become detached when the EntityManger is closed. Working with detached objects, including merging them back to an EntityManager.

Example: The JPA 2 provides a detach() method to detach an entity object.
em.detach(employee);
