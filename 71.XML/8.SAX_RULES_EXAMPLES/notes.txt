// SAX XML Parsing Example Notes

// MyHandler.java
// - Extends DefaultHandler
// - Uses boolean flags (bAge, bName, bGender, bRole) to track which element is being parsed
// - startElement: initializes Employee object, sets id, and flags for fields
// - endElement: adds Employee to list when </Employee> is found
// - characters: sets the value for the current field based on the flag

// XMLParserSAX.java
// - Main class to run SAX parsing
// - Creates SAXParser and MyHandler
// - Parses employees.xml and prints Employee objects

// Employee.java
// - POJO for Employee with id, name, gender, age, role
// - Getters, setters, and toString() for pretty printing

// employees.xml
// - Sample XML file with Employee data
// - Each Employee has id, age, name, gender, and role

// How it works:
// 1. SAXParser reads employees.xml
// 2. MyHandler creates Employee objects as it parses
// 3. Data is set using characters() and boolean flags
// 4. List<Employee> is returned and printed

// This is a basic example of SAX parsing in Java for educational purposes.
