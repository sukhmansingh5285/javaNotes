# Using SAX Parser

SAX Parser is different from the **DOM Parser**. SAX parser doesn’t load the complete XML into memory. Instead, it parses the XML line 
by line, triggering different events as it encounters elements like opening tags, closing tags, character data, comments, etc. 
This is why SAX Parser is called an event-based parser.

Along with the XML source file, we also register a handler that extends the `DefaultHandler` class. The `DefaultHandler` class provides 
different callbacks, out of which we are mainly interested in:

- `startElement()` — triggers when the start of a tag is encountered.
- `endElement()` — triggers when the end of a tag is encountered.
- `characters()` — triggers when some text data is encountered.

Java SAX Parser provides an API to parse XML documents. SAX Parsers are different from DOM parsers because they don’t load the 
complete XML into memory and read XML documents sequentially.

`javax.xml.parsers.SAXParser` provides methods to parse XML documents using event handlers. This class implements the `XMLReader` 
interface and provides overloaded versions of `parse()` methods to read XML documents from File, InputStream, SAX InputSource, and String URI.

The actual parsing is done by the Handler class. We need to create our own handler class to parse the XML document. To do this, 
implement the `org.xml.sax.ContentHandler` interface to create custom handler classes. This interface contains callback methods that 
receive notifications when any event occurs, for example: `StartDocument`, `EndDocument`, `StartElement`, `EndElement`, `CharacterData`, etc.

`org.xml.sax.helpers.DefaultHandler` provides a default implementation of the `ContentHandler` interface. We can extend this class to 
create our own handler. It’s advisable to extend this class because we might need to implement only a few of the methods.

**Main callback methods:**

- startDocument
- startElement
- characters
- comments
- processing instructions
- endElement
- endDocument
