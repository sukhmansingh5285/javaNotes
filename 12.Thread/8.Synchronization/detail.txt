these codes are to be used for the interview conditions also, like lock on lock, object, method, class, and using
static keyword, too.


there were 5/6 ways, these are what i remember

normal method synchronization

synchronized class and tutor made some method static to show the class lock

synchronized block, you have commented a lot to show this one

tutor also created deadlock where program hanged and all the threads were in pool when 1 thread got suspened in the code,
so later suspend and resume methods was deprecated, and 2 new methods were created -> wait and notify (4, 5, 6 programs are based on it,
 which are in 2.wait&notify folder)
