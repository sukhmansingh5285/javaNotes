MyClient1 -> creates the object(emp) and saves it.
It writes this object to a file named appsquadz3 using ObjectOutputStream.

MyServer -> reads from appsquadz3
prints name and age successfully, a:0 (was transient, 0 is default for integers), b:0(static), z:0(Base isn't serialized)

Same process in MyClient2 and MyServer1


///////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Base.java -> parent class with variable z
emp.java -> child class who implements serializable.

transient -> The transient keyword in Java is used to indicate that a field should not be serialized when an 
              object is written to a stream
Static and parent inherited are also not serialized (if parent didn't implemented Serializable)
