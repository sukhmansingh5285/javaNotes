Important Points So Far:-

Serialization -> Serialization is a process of converting an object into stream.
Deserialization -> Deserialization is a process of converting the stream into object.

Advantages of Serialization -> 1. To save the state of an object or to persist an object.
                               2. To travel an object on network.

Rules for Serialization -> 
1).Only the objects of those classes can be serialized which are implementing Serializable interface.
2).Serializable interface doesn't have any method that's why it is known as marker interface.
3).If a parent class has implemented Serializable interface then child class does not need to implement it but vice versa is not true.
4).Only the instance data members are saved via serialization process.
5).Static data members and transient data members are not saved via serialization process.
6).If you do not want to save the value of any instance data member via serialization process then make it transient.
7).When we deserialize an object then the constructor of that class is never executed.
8).The classes of associated objects must be implementing Serializable interface.
State of an object -> The current values of data members of an object is known as state of an object.

The serialization compiletime associates with each serialzable class a version number, called a serialVersionUID, which is used 
during deserialization to verify that the sender and receiver of a serialzed object have loaded classes for that object that are
compatible with respect to serialization. If the receiver has loaded a class for the object that has a different serialVersionUID 
than that of the corresponding sender's class, then deserialization will result in an InvalidClassException. A serializable 
class can declare its own serialVersionUID explicitly by declaring a field named "serialVersionUID" that must be static, final,
and of type long.

ANY-ACCESS-MODIFIER static final long serialVersionUID = 42L;

If a serializable  class does not explicitly declare a serialVersionUID, then the serialization compiletime will calculate a 
default serialVersionUID valued for that class based on various aspects of the class, as described in the Java Object Serialization
Specification. However, it is strongly recommended that all serializable classes explicitly declare serialVersionUID values, since
the default serialVersionUID computation is highly sensitive to class details that may very depending on compiler implementations,
many details including fields in your class, there access modifier, the interface they implement and even different Compiler implementations,
any change on class or using different compiler may result in different serialVersionUID, which many eventually stop reloading serialized
data. It's too risky to rely on Java Serialization mechanism for generating this id, and that's why it's recommended to declare explicitly
SerialVersionUID in your Serializable class and can thus result in unexpected InvalidClassExceptions during deserialization.

You can use JDK's serialver tool to generate SerialVersionUID for classes.

$ serialver -classpath . emp
Emp: static final long SerialVersionUID = -4862926644813433707L;
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now we know what is SerialVersionUID and why it's Important to declare it in Serializable class, it's time to revise some of the 
important fact, related to Java SerialVersionUID.

1) SerialVersionUID is used to version serialized data. You can only de-serialize a class if it's SerialVersionUID matches with the
  serialized instance.
2) When we don't declare SerialVersionUID in our class, Java compiletime generates it for us, but that process is sensitive to 
  many class meta data including number of fields, type of fields, access modifier of fileds, interface implemented by class, etc.
3) It's recommended to declare SerialVersionUID as private static final long variable to avoid default mechanism.
4) You can even use serialver tool frok JDK to generate Serial Version for classes in Java.
5) It's Serialization best practice in Java to explicitly declare SerialVersionUID, to avoid any issues during de-serialization
  especially if you are running a client server application which relies on serialized data e.g. RMI.
