/*

1. In this example, class Car Implements Externalizable interface which means that car object is ready for serialization.
   This class has two public methods -> "writeExternal" and "readExternal". Unlike Serializable interface which will
   serialize all the variables in the object with just by implementing the interface, here you have to explicitly mention
   what fields or variables you want to serialize and the same is done in "writeExternal" and "readExternal" methods. So 
   in the "ExternExample" class, when you write the "Car" object to the OutputStream, the "writeExternal" method is called
   and the data is persisted. The same applies to "readExternal" method in the Car object, i.e., when you read the "Car"
   object from the ObjectInputStream, "readExternal" method is called.

2. Also the information about class description is added to the stream which includes the description of all serializable
   superclasses, the description of the class and the instance data associated with the specific instance of the class.
   Lots of data and metadata and again performance issue.

3. Now when an Externalizable object is reconstructed, an instance is created first using the public no-arg constructor,
   then the readExternal method is called.

4. When an object that implements Serializable interface, is serialized or de-serialized, no constructor of the object
   is called and hence any initialization which is done in the constructor can't be done.

5. Externalization is nothing but serialization buy by implementing Externalizable interface to persist and restore the
   object. To externalize your object, you need to implement Externalizable interface that extends Serializable interface.
   Here only the identity of the class is written in the serialization stream and it is the responsibility of the class
   to save and restore the contents of its instance which means you will have complete control of what to serialize and 
   what not to serialize. But with serialization the identity of all the classes, its superclasses, instance variables
   and then the contents for these items is written to the serialization stream. But to externalize an object, you need
   a default public constructor.

6. Limitations of Serialization
   1) File size is very high.
   2) Customization due to transient which is not effective because we get null in place of transient attributes.
  
7. One thing you can do with Externalization is that you can store extra information into object like STATIC variables
   and transient variables or you can add more information if you have any business need.

8. Externalization allows you to customize how serialization is done. By implementing externalization you are controlling
what gets serialzied (and what doesn't) as versus default serialzation where all non-transient attributes get serialzed.
