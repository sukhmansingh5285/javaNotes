Fetch Size

By default, when Oracle JDBC executes a query, it receives the result set 10 rows at a time from the database cursor. This is the default Oracle 
row-prefetch value. You can change the number of rows retrieved with each trip to the database cursor by changing the row-prefetch value.

JDBC 2.0 also allows you to specify the number of rows fetched with each database round trip for a query, and this number is referred to as the fetch size. 
In Oracle JDBC, the row-prefetch value is used as the default fetch size in a statement object. Setting the fetch size overrides the row-prefetch 
setting and affects subsequent queries executed through that statement object.

Fetch size is also used in a result set. When the statement object executes a query, the fetch size of the statement object is passed to the result 
set object produced by the query. However, you can also set the fetch size in the result set object to override the statement fetch size that was 
passed to it. (Also note that changes made to a statement object's fetch size after a result set is produced will have no affect on that result set.)

Setting the Fetch Size

The following methods are available in all Statement, PreparedStatement, CallableStatement, and ResultSet objects for setting and getting the fetch size:

	void setFetchSize(int rows) throws SQLException
	int getFetchSize() throws SQLException

To set the fetch size for a query, call setFetchSize() on the statement object prior to executing the query. If you set the fetch size to N, then N 
rows are fetched with each trip to the database.
