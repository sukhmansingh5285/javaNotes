if you want to execute a Statement object many times, it usually reduces execution time to use a PreparedStatement object instead.

The main feature of a PreparedStatement object is that, unlike a Statement object, it is given a SQL statement when it is created. 
The advantage to this is that in most cases, this SQL statement is sent to the DBMS right away, where it is compiled. As a result, 
the PreparedStatement object contains not just a SQL statement, but a SQL statement that has been precompiled. This means that when
 the PreparedStatement is executed, the DBMS can just run the PreparedStatement SQL statement without having to compile it first.

A PreparedStatement is a special kind of Statement object with some useful features. Remember, you need a Statement in order to
 execute either a query or an update. You can use a PreparedStatement instead of a Statement and benefit from the features of the
  PreparedStatement.

The PreparedStatement's primary features are:

	Easy to insert parameters into the SQL statement.
	Easy to reuse the PreparedStatement with new parameters.
	May increase performance of executed statements.
	Enables easier batch updates.
